UniPorot database 包括 UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB)、UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef)和UniProt Archive (UniParc).
UniProtKB: the central hub for the collection of functional information on proteins, with accurate, consistent 
           and rich annotation.
           
UniRef:provide clustered sets of sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase (including isoforms) and selected UniParc
        records in order to obtain complete coverage of the sequence space at several resolutions while hiding 
        redundant sequences (but not their descriptions) from view.
        
UniParc:is a comprehensive and non-redundant database that contains most of the publicly available protein sequences
        in the world. Proteins may exist in different source databases and in multiple copies in the same database.
